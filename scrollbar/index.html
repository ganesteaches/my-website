    <p>…. The principle
Cosmic‐ray production
High-energy cosmic rays strike atoms in the upper atmosphere, producing neutrons. These neutrons collide with nitrogen-14 (^14N), converting it to radioactive carbon-14 (^14C):

n
  
⟶

C
+
p
.
14
 N+n⟶ 
14
 C+p.
Incorporation into living organisms
Carbon-14 oxidises to CO₂, which plants take up via photosynthesis—and thus enters the food chain. While an organism is alive, it maintains a constant ratio of ^14C to the stable isotopes ^12C and ^13C, matching that of the atmosphere.

Decay and the half-life
Once the organism dies, it stops replenishing ^14C. The ^14C then decays back to ^14N by β⁻ emission with a half-life of about 5 730 years. After one half-life, only half of the original ^14C remains; after two half-lives, one quarter remains; and so on.

2. Calculating an age
Measure the current ratio.
In the laboratory, the ^14C/^12C (or ^14C/^13C) ratio of the sample is determined—typically by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) or liquid-scintillation counting.

Compare to the atmospheric ratio.
We assume the initial ^14C/^12C ratio (when the organism died) equals that of the atmosphere at that time.

Apply the decay law.
The decay follows an exponential law:

3. Calibration
Atmospheric ^14C production has varied over time (solar activity, geomagnetic field, fossil-fuel burning, nuclear tests, etc.), so a straightforward application of the decay law gives a radiocarbon age that must be corrected to a calendar age using calibration curves (e.g. IntCal20). These curves are built by comparing ^14C dates of samples of known age (tree-rings, corals, varves) to their true calendar ages.

4. Range and limits
Aspect	Details
Effective range	Up to ~50 000 years before present; beyond that the residual ^14C is too small.
Sample types	Organic materials: wood, charcoal, bone, shell, peat, textiles, etc.
Contamination	Modern carbon contamination can make a sample appear too “young”; geological carbon can make it appear “old”. Must clean/pre-treat carefully.
Reservoir effects	Marine and freshwater organisms may incorporate “old” carbon from dissolved limestone or deep water, skewing apparent age. Often requires local offset correction.
Precision	±20–50 years for recent (last few millennia) samples; decreases for older samples due to diminishing ^14C.

5. Applications
Archaeology and anthropology: dating wooden tools, cave art, textiles, bone remains.

Geology and palaeoclimatology: timing of peat bog formation, glacier advances/retreats (via organic sediments).

Forensics: estimating time since death for relatively recent human remains.

Environmental science: tracing sources of carbon in pollution or carbon cycling studies.

6. Example calculation
Suppose a charcoal sample has a measured ^14C/^12C ratio of 0.25 relative to the modern standard. The decay constant λ ≈ 0.000121 yr⁻¹, so

After calibration against IntCal20, that radiocarbon age might correspond to, say, 9200 – 9000 BC (depending on calibration curve shapes in that interval).

After calibration against IntCal20, that radiocarbon age might correspond to, say, 9200 – 9000 BC (depending on calibration curve shapes in that interval).
